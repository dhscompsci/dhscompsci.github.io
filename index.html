                    <div id = "text"><p>Due to Homecoming activities, our first after-school meeting has been rescheduled for Tuesday, October 28th immediately after school. At this meeting, guest speaker Gerald Jackson will present "Computer Science: What It Is, What It Does, and What It's Good For." Whether a computer novice or a computer expert, Mr. Jackson's presentation has something for everyone. A tentative schedule for the building of our annual project, the Dreher High School app, will also be distributed. I hope to see everyone in Mr. Hamrick's room at 3:30 on October 28th!</p></div>
